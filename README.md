Attempt at making a 2D top-down adventure game inspired by pokemon

I worked on this project over the course of about two months or so all things considered
That included experimenting with PyGame and a bunch of other experiments, I only worked in Unity for
about a month of so before the due date.

I had MANY issues while building this project. Firstly, I had to become familiar with Unity and C#, which
are skills I definitely do not regret learning. I can only imagine how these can help me in the future.

I originally wanted to include a fishing minigame, but didn't have time to to make it in the end. 

The buttons on the battle screen gave me many problems, but through a lot of googling and scouring youtube I was able to 
find videos that gave lessons I could more or less apply to project. 

The game isn't perfect. 

It has some bugs and some clunky UI. However, considering I solo dev'd this, and it was my first attempt at ever making a
video game, or any video game music, I'm pretty proud of the progress I was able to make. Hopefully I can use this experience 
in the future to actually build a side project that other people could enjoy.

Overall, this was one of the most challenging and rewarding projects I've ever worked on in computer science or any sort of design,
and I highly reccomennd for all programmers to give it a shot. When you're working on something because YOU want it to you, and you're not
just getting it done for a deadline, you don't even notice the hours passing by. I also think that's when you learn the most. Either way,
I hope you enjoy the game.
